# lpg_sensor
LPG alarm using MQ-6 sensor and Arduino.

# Brief
This is an LPG detection and alarm system based off a MQ-6 sensor that runs on an Arduino Pro Mini (ATMEGA328P). The readings are adjusted for the temperature and humidity by using a DHT22 sensor. It also utilises a watchdog timer to make sure the sensor is always running.
